                  <h2><u>Windows Tips</u></h2>
                  <p>If you're on windows, you can start coding using Notepad.</p>
                  <p>If this is the case, you can open Notepad, type:
                    <pre><code>print("Hello World")</code></pre>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that you have some code, lets save it and run it. You can go to File, Save As, save as helloworld.py.</p>
                  <p>Now to run the file, go to your command prompt, you can type in cmd in the windows search.</p>
                  <p>Once it opens, you want to make sure you are in the directory of where your python file is saved. For easy use, save it to your desktop.</p>
                  <p>Next you type the following:
                    <pre><code>cd Desktop</code> --> this goes to the directory where the python file is stored.</pre>
                    <pre><code>python3 helloworld.py</code> --> this will execute the python code.</pre>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your output should be:
                    <pre><code>Hello World</code></pre>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are many more advanced ways to do this. For now lets stick with simpicity.</p>
                  <h2><u>Mac OS X Tips</u></h2>
                  <p>If you're on Mac, you can start coding by using the given txt editor.</p>
                  <p>If this is the case, you can open the text editor, type:
                    <pre><code>print("Hello World")</code></pre>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now that you have some code, lets save it and run it. You can go to File, Save As, save as helloworld.py.</p>
                  <p>It might ask you if you want to overrite the .txt ending, choose yes and choose .py extension instead.</p>
                  <p>Now to run the file, go to your terminal, you can find this by hitting command and space then typing terminal.</p>
                  <p>Once it opens, you want to make sure you are in the directory of where your python file is saved. For easy use, save it to your desktop.</p>
                  <p>Next you type the following:
                    <pre><code>cd Desktop</code> --> this goes to the directory where the python file is stored.</pre>
                    <pre><code>python3 helloworld.py</code> --> this will execute the python code.</pre>
                  </p>
                  <p>Your output should be:
                    <pre><code>Hello World</code></pre>
                  </p>
                  <p>Example of how it all should look:
                  <pre><code>username@Username ~ % cd Desktop
username@Username Desktop % python3 test.py
Hello World </code></pre>
                  </p>
                  <h2><u>Personal Tips</u></h2>
                  <h3>Some of my Favorite Code Editors:</h3>
                  <p>I am a Mac user and I like to you use <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/" target="_blank"> Xcode</a>. It is built specificially for
                    Mac users. Very easy to use for beginners. It has so many feautures for more advanced developers.
                  </p>
                  <p>I am also a big fan of using <a href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank"> Atom</a>. This code editor can be used on Windows as well. It is
                  also very user friendly and simple to use. Very customizeable to your wants. This is also a very powerful code editor for more advanced developers.</p>
                  <h3>What to do when you get stuck?</h3>
                  <p>It is the 21st century, there are so many resources out there. If you happen to get stuck or start getting frusturated, it is okay to put
                    down what you are doing and take a break. Coding is fun, interactive, and requires your own creativity. The internet wasn't built in a day, so you
                    don't feel the need to solve all problems in one day.
                  </p>

                  <p>Now that you have everything you set up, and you understand how to save and run a python file. Lets get to programming</p>
                  <p style=color:red>It is very important that you understand the concpet of running and saving a python file. It will save you time going forward.</p>
                  <p>First we will begin with simple calculations and then move on to variables. Why? Because variables are used to store things in a computer program
                  and they will be useful very soon.</p>
                  <h3>Calulating using Python</h3>
                  <p>How would you find the product of 3 x 9.8 numbers? You can just use a calculator or a pencil.</p>
                  <p>The simplicity of that is the same using python. In our code editor lets type the following:</p>
                  <code>print(3 * 9.8)</code>
                  <p>Output will be: 29.4</p>
                  <p>Do you see a difference between what coded and what you would write? The difference is the 'x'. </p>
                  <p>In python, you will come to see that syntax is very important. That is why for multiplication we use the asterik (*) instead of the standard (x).</p>
                  <p>Solving a word Example:</p>
                  <p>I will give you 10 dollars everytime you walk my dog, and at the end of the month I will add 5 dollars. Lets say you do this everyday for a year, how much money will you have earned?</p>
                  <p>On paper the equations might look like: </p>
                  <code>$10 x 365 = 3650 --> Walking my dog everyday</code>  <br>
                  <code>$5 x 12 = 60 --> 5 dollars at the end of the every month </code> <br>
                  <code> $3650 + $60 = $3710  --> Total money earned at the end of the year.</code>
                  <p>Luckily for python, you can do this directly as well. However you would not hav eto do any of the math, the program will do it all for you. </p>
                  <p>This is how it would look like if you wrote it in python:</p>
                  <code>print(10 * 365) --> OUTPUT: 3650</code> <br>
                  <code>print(5 x 12) --> OUTPUT: 60</code><br>
                  <code>print(3650 + 60) --> OUTPUT: 3710</code>
                  <p>This is a very simple math operation. We will get much more into depth further down.</p>
                  <p>Python allows for the use of multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction. Though python is simple, it allows for much
                  more advanced mathematical operations that we will not cover right now.</p>
                  <h4>Python Operators</h4>
                  <p>+ Addition</p>
                  <p>- Subtraction</p>
                  <p>* Multiplication</p>
                  <p>/ Division, when writing on paper, the most common form of division is ÷, but for python we use the forward slash.</p>
                  <h4>Order of Operations</h4>
                  <p>Just like doing math on paper, there are operations and logic that needs to be followed. Using PEMDAS is the best way to follow your logic
                  when doing operations in python.</p>
                  <p>When doing math operations in python, the best way to follow logic is to use ().</p>
                  <p>Multiplication and division have a higher order than addition and subtraction, which means that they’re performed first.
                    With this being said, if you create an equation in Python, multiplication or division is performed  first, then addition or subtraction.</p>
                  <p>Example with no ():</p>
                  <p>Type the following in your text editor:</p>
                  <code>5 + 30 * 20</code>
                  <p>After running it, result will be 605</p>
                  <p>Example with ()</p>
                  <p>Using the same numbers as above. Type the following: </p>
                  <code>(5 + 30) * 20</code>
                  <p>Notice that the result is different. This time we get 700.</p>
                  <p>That is because we are saying: Do the operation in the parentheses first,  then do the operations outside the parentheses. </p>
                  <p style="color:red">Remember, multiplication and division always go before addition and subtraction. Unless () are used to control the order of operations</p>

                  <h3>Variables</h3>
                  <p>In programming, the term variable that is used to store information- numbers, text, lists of numbers and text, etc..</p>
                  <p>Example:</p>
                  <p>To create a variable named number, we will use the symbol =</p>
                  <p>We then tell Python the information we want it to hold.</p>
                  <p>In this case, we want our variable number to hold the number 25</p>
                  <p>So we type the following in our code editor:</p>
                  <code>number = 25</code>
                  <p>To show what information this variable holds, we can also add a print statement.</p>
                  <code>print(number)</code>
                  <p>After running it, out put should be: 25</p>
                  <p>In python we can also use more than one variable for the same item.</p>
                  <p>For example:</p>
                  <code>number = 25</code><br>
                  <code>new_number = number</code><br>
                  <code>print(new_number)</code><br>
                  <code>OUTPUT: 25</code>
                  <p>Here we see that we assign number, which holds the value 25, to our new variable, new_number. We can then print our new variable, and
                  it will have the output of the old variable.</p>
                  <h4>Lets do some math using Variables</h4>
                  <p>Lets use the world example we did previously.</p>
                  <p>Solving a word Example:</p>
                  <p>I will give you 10 dollars everytime you walk my dog, and at the end of the month I will add 5 dollars. Lets say you do this everyday for a year, how much money will you have earned?</p>

                  <p style="color:red">Try this on your own before checking for the answer!</p>
                  <p>Here the goal is to assign our math values to variables and then doing the math operations to find the total amount of money made from walking my dog for a year.</p>

                    <code>amount_perMonth_perYear = 60 #5 * 12</code><br>
                    <code>total_amount = days * amount_perDay + amount_perMonth_perYear</code><br>
                    <code>OUTPUT: 3710</code>

                  <p>Now that you understand the basics of variables and calculations using python, lets move on.</p>
                  <p style = "color:red;">Again, please follow along to get the most of learning python. Get your code editor and environment ready.</p>
                  <p style = "color:red;">I will be using # this for comments. If you use this in your code editor, the program won't read it as code, it is just there
                  for your use.</p>
                  <p>In this lesson we will talk about other Python items: Strings, Lists, Tuples, and Maps</p>
                  <p>We will touch on how each item is used. <br> For example: Strings are are used to display messages.</p>
                  <h3>Using Strings in Python</h3>
                  <p>What is a string?<br>When programming, string is a mmore technical term for <i>text.</i></p>
                  <p>If you look at a book, the whole think can be a string, your name can be considered a string as well. <br>
                    The most popular string phrase in python: "Hello World." Which you learned how to do in lesson 1.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <h4>Creating Strings</h4>
                  <p>To create strings in python, you can use single quotes ('') and double quotes ("").</p>
                  <p>For example: <br><br>
                    <code>name = "Python" #or name = 'Python'</code> <br> <br>
                    Now, if you run this, the output will be empty. Why? Because we need to access the variable and print it.<br><br>
                    <code>print(name) #OUTPUT: Python</code>
                  </p>
                  <p>When using strings, it is always wise that you look it over and make sure that you have closed off the string. <br>
                  By this, I mean make sure there is " or ' at the ened of your string, depending on which one you are using.</p>
                  <p>If you don't you can run into some errors: <br>
                    <code>name  = 'Python</code><br>
                    <code>print(name)</code><br>
                    <code style="color: red">OUTPUT: SyntaxError: EOL while scanning string literal</code><br><br>
                    This means that you did not close off your string, and if you look at the example, we missed a '. <br>
                    One error that you will come by often is a <strong>SYNTAX</strong> error. This means that there was something done in your python program, that Python was not expecting, or Python was expecting something that you missed. <br> EOL means end-of-line, so the rest of the error message is telling you that Python hit the end of the line and did not find a double quote or single quote to close the string that you created. <br><br>
                    <button onclick="SyntaxError()">Here is a list of Invalid Syntax in Python.</button>
                    <div id="ISEP" style="display: none;">
                      <p>You can see examples of these <a href="https://realpython.com/invalid-syntax-python/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
                      <li>Misusing the Assignment Operator (=)</li>
                      <li>Misspelling, Missing, or Misusing Python Keywords.</li>
                      <li>Missing Parentheses, Brackets, and Quotes.</li>
                      <li>Mistaking Dictionary Syntax.</li>
                      <li>Using the Wrong Indentation.</li>
                      <li>Defining and Calling Functions.</li>
                      <li>Changing Python Versions.</li>
                    </div>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another form of writing strings is using the <strong>Multiline String</strong>.</p>
                  <p>This method looks like: ''' some text '''</p>
                  <p>Using a multiline string allows you to format text in almost anyway you want. It will take the into account how many indents, spaces, line breaks, 
                  the proper punctuation, and much more. This solves many of the syntax errors when using strings.</p>
                  <p>Before we get into some examples, one awesome way to embedd values in a string is using (%s). <br>
                    This acts as a marker for a value that you created and will like to add to your string.<br>
                    For example:<br>
                    <code>points = 30</code><br>
                    <code>msg = 'I scored %s points out of a possible 40.'</code><br>
                    <code>print(msg % points)</code><br>
                    <code>OUTPUT: I scored 30 points out of a possible 40.</code><br><br>
                    As you can see, the value 30 gets embedded in our msg string. <br>
                    Another think you can also do with strings is multiply them, for example: <br>
                    <code>print(10 * 'b')</code><br>
                    <code>OUTPUT: bbbbbbbbbb</code><br><br>
                    This outputs the letter b 10 times.
                  </p>
                  <p>Lets do an example using the <i>Multiline String</i>. Lets create a letter using python.</p>
                  <p style="color: red;">Make sure you have your environment set up.</p>
                  <code>
                    spaces = ' ' * 25 #this will add 25 spaces<br>
                    #lets create a random address <br>
                    print('%s 1111 python drive' % spaces) <br>
                    print('%s Programming Language' % spaces)<br>
                    print('%s Denver, CO' % spaces)<br>
                    print()<br>
                    print()<br>
                    print('Dear Python User,')<br>
                    print()<br>
                    print('I want to let you know that I believe you will learn a lot from this site.')<br>
                    print('It is very informative and easy to learn.')<br>
                    print()<br>
                    print('Sincerely,')<br>
                    print('Website Creator')<br><br>
                  </code>

                  <p>This concludes the section for introduction to strings. However, we are no where near done using them.</p>

                  <h3>Basics of Lists in Python</h3>
                  <p>Lets say you are going to go to the grocery store to by: Eggs, Ham, Cheese, Bread, Lettuce, Tomatoes.</p>
                  <p>We would be able to store this grocery list in python as follows: <br><br>
                    <code>grocery_list = 'Eggs, Ham, Cheese, Bread, Lettuce, Tomatoes'<br>
                    print(grocery_list)<br>
                  OUTPUT: Eggs, Ham, Cheese, Bread, Lettuce, Tomatoes</code><br><br>
                  Though this is simple, we will not be able to manipulate this string for future use. <br>
                  Instead we can use a list.
                  </p>
                  <p>We write our new grocery list as follows:<br>
                    <code>store_list = ['Eggs', 'Ham', 'Cheese', 'Bread', 'Lettuce', 'Tomatoes'] <br>
                      print(store_list) <br>
                      OUTPUT:['Eggs', 'Ham', 'Cheese', 'Bread', 'Lettuce', 'Tomatoes']
                      <br>
                    </code>
                      It does take a little more typing to create a list, but now we can access out items individually and manipulate our grocery list.
                  </p>
                  <p>For example, if we wanted to get the our 3rd item from our grocery list, we do this by entering the item position in the list (called the index position) inside square brackets ([]). Like this: <br>
                    <code>print(store_list[2]) <br>
                      OUTPUT: Cheese
                    </code><br><br>
                    Now you might be asking, why did I put 2 instead of 3 since I wanted to get the 3rd item?<br>
                    This is because  ists start at index position 0. The first item in a list is 0, then the second is 1, the third is 2, and so on. <br>
                    This may take some getting use to, but for computers, that is how it makes sense. <br>
                    Here is a great explanation provided by <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/arrays-start-at-zero-whats-up-with-that-f2d1054c9b77" target="_blank"> Jonathan Bluks</a>
                  </p>
                  <p>Going back to our manipulation of lists, lets say we remembered we had something but need something else. We can change an item by doing the following.</p>
